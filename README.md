## React TextArea Auto Resize

The react-textarea-auto-resize npm package is a utility that provides an auto-resizing feature for textarea components in React. It automatically adjusts the height of a textarea based on its content, allowing it to grow or shrink dynamically as the user types or deletes text.

When using this package, you no longer need to manually handle the resizing logic or set fixed rows for the textarea. Instead, the package takes care of adjusting the height to fit the content.
